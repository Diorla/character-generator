# Correlations
- Between body colour and hair
  - So, someone with dark skin is less likely to have blue eyes compared to someone with white skin
- Add albino too
  - And appropriate eye and hair colour.


# Add body features
- Like long legs or busty
  - This will rely on initial body size
  - E.g. A short person can't won't have long legs
  - But an average or tall person may have a disproportionately long arms and/or legs

# Bugs
- The app is not handling rotation properly
- If it's in the portrait when you open the app
  - If you turn it into landscape, scrollView doesn't work
  - A section of the app is cut off, and doesn't scroll
  - The same happens when it starts with landscape and then rotate to portrait
  - About half of the screen is just blank.
  - **Solution**: Restrict to portrait only.
